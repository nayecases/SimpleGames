z - I can't believe I'm in this situation. Everything was going so well... I guess we were walking on eggshells. Now I'm here all alone, the crew left an hour ago. I'm just waiting for someone to pass by and maybe, lent my a hand. I can't wait here any longer, it's driving me crazy. I should look around...
